Question --

Ayush is given a number 'X'. He has been told that he has to find the first 'X' terms of the series 3 * 'N' + 2, which are not multiples of 4. Help Ayush to find it as he has not been able to answer. 
Example: Given an 'X' = 4. The output array/list which must be passed to Ayush will be [5, 11, 14, 17].

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10^2
1 <= X <= 10^5

Time Limit: 1 sec


Solution --

import java.util.* ;
import java.io.*; 
public class Solution {
	public static int[] termsOfAP(int x){
		// Write your code here.
		int[] result = new int[x];
    int count = 0;
    int num = 5; // The initial number in the sequence
    
    // Compute the first x numbers in the sequence
    for (int i = 0; count < x; i++) {
        if (num % 4 != 0) {
            result[count] = num;
            count++;
        }
        num += (i % 2 == 0) ? 9 : 2; // Use 9 or 2 as the increment alternatively
    }
    
    return result;
	}
}
